## Notebook Usage

Notebooks are organized by cells, which mainly consist of text (in markdown) and code (Python). It operations like a hybrid between MS Word and Excel file; whereas the entire file is like a document, the cells operate like a spreadsheet. For getting started, feel free to scroll down each cell and navigate around the cells for a quick tour. Here is a breakdown of how to view/edit cells:

1. Each cell may be edited by hitting ENTER; toggle between cells using the arrow keys or mouse/scroller
2. When editing a cell, be sure to select "markdown" for text or "code" before writing into it
3. Each cell can be run by hitting CTRL + ENTER or the "run" button form the menu bar
4. Output from each cell will appear below; if an error occurs, please read and try to debug it(!)
5. File can be saved by hitting CTRL + "s" or file/save from the pulldown menu above

## The Python Programming Language

This tutorial will cover some basic programming, so we will focus on learning the Python programming language for this notebook since it is widely used and gain enough traction to be caught in [high school](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/intropython) and AP Computer Science [courses](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/high-school).

[Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) supports several different languages (R, Scala and Julia); however, Python is the most popular of them and can be used for other tasks, primarily data science and web programming.

## Installation Instructions

1. Create Help Desk ticket to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) application
2. Verify that Jupyter Notebook was installed; it will be visible from Windows Start menu
3. Start Jupyter Notebook; it will start CMD shell and load in the web browser
4. Save this notebook and CSV data to your "Documents" folder and navigate to it from the Notebook start page
5. Open this notebook from the start page; file and cells should be viewable
6. This notebook contains introductory tutorial for getting started and running rules
