## Introduction

This notebook is a dashboard publication tool via Jupyter-Voila. It is developed based on this [tutorial](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/interactive-dashboard-post) by Duarte O. Carmo. He has also published an article to outline his tutorial [here](https://pbpython.com/interactive-dashboards.html).

This notebook is organized into modules to complete the following tasks:

1. Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Dashboard Publication

## VTA Open Data

This dashboard visualizes cumulative monthly ridership from the VTA Open Data [Portal](http://data.vta.org/). The Portal is described as "central location for access to VTA's open data, including transit, active transportation, congestion management and more."

The [monthly ridership data](http://data.vta.org/datasets/ridership-by-route-cumulative-monthly) includes fields for train route, line type, ridership and cumulative monthly period. It consists of data from 2013 to 2018.
